# WMIC-Uninstaller
Uninstall any software using WMIC

I am trying to create a WMIC Uninstaller.
It will ask the user the software they want to Uninstall
It will store that into a variable
WMIC will find the product ID of the software
Then, stores in into a variable ( Can't figure that out}
Then, uses msiexec command to uninstall that software..
